  ScilabSerialLib (SiSeLi) Mini Documentation, V0.5
 ===================================================
  Serial Port DLL for Scilab (Windoze).
  (c)ASkr, 10/2012
  www.askrprojects.net

  

1.0 INTRODUCTION

    A serial port DLL for Scilab and Windoze.
    No time for sensless drivel, just a few words and then on to the interesting part:
    
    Scilab, serial, unhappy, didn't work, few hours, programming, new one, 1-8 ports, sharing
    ;-)

    
1.1 FEATURES    

    See Chapter 3 for a complete function reference.
    ...

    
1.2 REQUIREMENTS    

    SiSeLi requires Scilab version 5.3+ and comes in 32 and 64 bit variants.
      
    Scilab does not run under Windows-2000 any more (*1*), so at least Windows XP is required.

    Beside Windows and a running Scilab installation, nothing else should be required.
    
    Is it stable?
    Well, as of version 5, Scilab itself is everything else but stable. Any other version
    below V5.3.0 did not even work on my systems (and I really tried a lot of different
    combinations!). Plot windows did not work, contiguous crashes... On some systems, I could
    not even read the console... But 5.3.0-BETA4 really is a great improvement!
    Usually, Scilab crashes before SiSeli does ;)
    
      NOTICE:
      All data transfer Scilab &lt;-&gt; SiSeLi is done with pointer arithmetic.
      The only way of securing memory integrity, would be adding more stuff to the Scilab
      wrapper functions (Scilab's own function definitions), at the cost of speed, so I skipped
      this. Especially the &quot;slSendArray(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;array&gt;, &lt;size&gt;)&quot; function (and maybe more in
      the future, see &quot;Packet Mode&quot;), relies on what you told it to do.
      If you assign a &lt;size&gt;, exceeding the limit of &lt;array&gt;, a memory exception will occur...
      Be careful !-)

    Can it be used with USB or Bluetooth virtual COM ports?
    Yes, although some extra care may be required. Sometimes, Windows &quot;reserves&quot; a COM port,
    although the device is not attached. In this case, you'll send all the data to nowhere
    and receive from anywhere. Basically this is not a problem until you use a function or
    mechanism that blocks until a byte is received. At this moment, Scilab will hang...
    But all the other time (you attached the device, the driver is loaded and you managed to
    get the right COM port number...) it will cause no (known) problems...
    I tested it with several FTDIs, several off-the-shelf USB &lt;-&gt; RS-232 converters, a few
    mobile phones and a pbLualized Lego NXT.
      
    (*1*) 5.3.0-BETA4 installation message box: &quot;At least Windows NT5.1 is required to run Scilab&quot;.

    
1.3 DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

    This one was created with the great DEV-CPP, freely available from
      http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html
    or
      http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/    
    Install and start to code ;)
    
    
1.4 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, TODO LIST:

    This project (the usual side project of 84 others) just started.
    I quickly hacked this together, but although it is working fine, it is not finished (10/2010).

      - implement packet receive methods

2.0 EXAMPLE USAGE

    For an in-depth explanation of (all) the SiSeLi Scilab-wrapper functions, see chapter 3.

    Extract SiSeLi's SCILAB directory, or only &quot;siseli.dll&quot; to a new directory on your hard disk.
    Start Scilab and change the path to there.

    - Load the libary:

        exec(&quot;slLoadLib.sci&quot;)

      If any error occurs, Scilab script execution is aborted via &quot;abort&quot;.
      There is no return variable available, but success or failure can be determined
      by the message that gets print out on the console.

    - Create a handle by mounting a port. A handle can be regarded as a reference number of an
      interface. By default, SiSeLi supports up to 8 interfaces.
      
        ret = slMount(1)
      
      Remember that number. From now on, every function call of the SiSeLi DLL wrapper functions
      require this number as an argument.
      Calling &quot;slMount(n)&quot; is once required before doing anything else. It internally creates
      all necessary objects an dependencies.

      Valid handles are n=1..8. If the mount succeeded, &quot;slMount()&quot; returns &quot;1&quot;. In case
      of an error, &quot;0&quot; is returned.

    - Check if a serial port is available (COM x):
      
        ret = slCheck(1,5)
      
      The first number is the handle, the second one specifies the number of the COM port.
      If COM5 is availabe and free, the function returns &quot;1&quot;, otherwise &quot;0&quot; is returned.
    
    - Set COMM parameters:
    
        ret = slConfig(1,19200,8,0,1)
      
      On handle &quot;1&quot; (first arg), use &quot;19200&quot; baud, &quot;8&quot; data bits, &quot;0&quot; no parity and &quot;1&quot; stop bit.
      If everything went right, &quot;1&quot; is returned, &quot;0&quot; otherwise.
      Notice that there is no COM port argument!
      
    - Open port:
    
        ret = slOpen(1,5)
        
      On handle &quot;1&quot;, open &quot;COM5&quot;. If successful, guess what, a &quot;1&quot; is returned (&quot;0&quot; on error).
      From now on, your serial interface is ready to send and receive data.
    
    - Sending a byte/character:
    
        ret = slSendByte(1,65)
        ret = slSendByte(1,ascii('A'))
        
      On handle &quot;1&quot;, both functions send an &quot;A&quot; out to the port (&quot;ascii('A')&quot; returns 65 too).
      Notice that this function is not limited to ASCII characters. Every value 0..255 is
      supported.
      As from here on, I skip commenting the value of the return arguments...
      I guess you got the clue ;)

    - Sending an array (2D):

        ret = slSendArray(1,a(1,:),size(a,2));
        ret = slSendArray(1,a(:,1),size(a,1));
        ret = slSendArray(1,a,length(a));
        ret = slSendArray(1,a',length(a));

      Assuming that &quot;a&quot; is an integer array of size(n,m), it can be sent as written above.
      First argument &quot;1&quot; is the handle, the second &quot;a&quot; an array (even an array of size [1,1]),
      the third and last one is the size of the array.
      NOTICE: It is extremly important that the given size DOES NOT EXCEED the length of
      the array (smaller values are OK). Otherwise memory exceptions will occur.

    - Checking bytes in the (receiving) buffer:
    
        bytes = slCount(1)

      This function returns the number of bytes available in the receive buffer.
      Internally, a thread receives and stores all incoming data bytes. If you (or Scilab)
      do not poll them fast enough and empty the buffer (see next function(s)), an overflow
      might occur. On overflow, slCount(&lt;handle&gt;) reports a &quot;-1&quot;.
      The overflow can only be reset by calling slFlush(&lt;handle&gt;).
      
    - Receiving a byte (Actually: reading it from the internal buffer):
    
        databyte = slReadByte(1,0)   // NON-BLOCKING (returns immediately)
        databyte = slReadByte(1,1)   // BLOCKING     (waits until a byte was received)

      If anything is in the receiving buffer, slReadbyte() returns one byte of that data,
      here on handle &quot;1&quot;. If the second argument is &quot;0&quot;, the function returns immediatley,
      even if the buffer is empty. A &quot;1&quot; as a second argument waits until at least one byte
      is received, it &quot;blocks&quot;.
      slReadByte returns either a valid data byte (value 0..255) or &quot;-1&quot; if the receive
      buffer is empty, an overflow occurs or the port is not opened.
      Notice that &quot;BLOCKING&quot; really blocks. Scilab will do absolutely nothing until a byte
      arrives (*subject to change in future versions*).

    - Closing the COM port:
    
        ret = slClose(1);
      
      After this call, the COM port is closed. You can not send or receive data anymore,
      but the handle is still valid for, e.g. slConfig(), which still allows chaning
      communication parameters, slOpen(), to re-open the port, etc...
      
    - Unmount handle:
    
        ret = slUMount(1)
    
      slUMount() frees the internal objects and dependecies. From now on, any access to this
      former handle is invalid, but the library is still loaded and ready to run.
      You still remember the return stuff, right? &quot;0&quot; is bad, &quot;1&quot; means good...
      
    - Unload library:

        ret = slUnload()
        
      Calling slUnload removes the library from memory. No go, until you execute
      exec(&quot;slLoadLib.sci&quot;) again.
      Do NOT call unload until the port is closed and unmounted!

      *NOTICE*:
      Due to some unresolved problems in Scilab, the wrapper functions (&quot;sl...&quot;) can not
      be removed that easily (Scilab becomes unstable).
      So a call to, e.g. slCount() will still try to access &quot;count&quot; in the DLL,
      
        function res=slCount(nHandle)
          res=fort(&quot;count&quot;,nHandle,1,&quot;i&quot;,&quot;out&quot;,[1,1],2,&quot;i&quot;)
        endfunction
        
      which will obviously fail...

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSetPacketChar(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;byte&gt;)

      
3.4 REFERENCE

3.4.1 slInit

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slInit()

      Notice: Not required if you use &quot;exec('slLoadLib.sci')&quot;!
      
      Initializes some internal objects.
      Needs to be called once before you do anything else.
      
      RETURNS:
        1     = OK
        

3.4.2 slLoad
        
        NULL    = slLoad()
        
        Notice: Not required if you use &quot;exec('slLoadLib.sci')&quot;!
        
        Opens &quot;siseli.dll&quot;, which has to be on your path (usually right inside the directory
        Scilab is currently operating in), and links the DLL functions.
        If any error occurs, execution will be aborted via &quot;abort&quot; (Scilab stops) and an
        error message is print out on the console.
        
        RETURNS:
          nothing

          
3.4.3 slVersion

      &lt;version&gt; = slVersion(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Returns a floating point representation of the libraries' version.
        E.g. V1.2 will return &quot;1.2&quot;.
        Requires a valid &lt;handle&gt; argument.
        
        RETURNS:
          &lt;version&gt; = floating point number of library version

          
3.4.4 slUnload()

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slUnload()
      
        Unloads the library from memory by removing all DLL links.
        Make sure all ports are closed (&quot;slClose(&lt;handle&gt;)&quot;) and unmounted (&quot;slUMount(&lt;handle&gt;)&quot;)
        before calling this. Otherwise strange things may happen!
        
        Example:
        
          // 2 COM ports are referenced by handle 2 and 5 and opened (communicating).
          // The right way to shut down everything is:
          slClose(2)
          slClose(5)
          slUMount(2)
          slUMount(5)
          slUnload()
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK; Even returns &quot;1&quot; if library was previously unloaded (nothing dramatic).
          0     = Something went wrong. may be someone deleted &quot;slFuncs&quot;, the link list?
     
     
3.4.5 slMount
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slMount(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Creates internal objects and dependencies. Needs to be called once, before anything else.
        &lt;handle&gt; is a 1..8 integer and can be regarded as a reference to exactly &quot;this&quot; (&lt;handle&gt;)
        COM port. This way, different COM ports, that are opened the same time, can be
        easily distimguished.
        
        Example:
        
          // You already executed &quot;exec('slLoadLib.sci')&quot; to load the library.
          // You decide to use handle 3 for a COM port (which may be opened later):
          slMount(3)
          // From now on, all the internal objects, necessary for operation, are created
          // and you can start to use the library functions.
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR, &lt;handle&gt; invalid
      
3.4.6 slUMount
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slUMount(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Deletes internal objects and dependencies. After this is called, the &lt;handle&gt; is invalid
        and can not be used any more, but the library is still loaded.
        Notice that the COM port, reference by &lt;handle&gt;, needs to be closed via slClose(&lt;handle&gt;),
        prior to calling this!
        
        Example:
        
          // Close COM port, referenced by handle 3 and destroy object:
          slClose(3)
          slUMount(3)
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK, everything deleted
          0     = ERROR, something very strange happened (you better restart Scilab ;-)
      
3.4.7 slCheck

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slCheck(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;port&gt;)
        
        Checks if COM port &lt;port&gt; is available and free.
        
        Example:
        
          // create handle 1 and check if COM4 is present and free:
          slMount(1)
          if slCheck(1,4) then
            printf(&quot;Port 4 available\n&quot;)
          else
            printf(&quot;Port over board!\n&quot;)
          end
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = port available, can be opened
          0     = port does not exist or is already opened by an other application


3.4.8 slConfig
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slConfig(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;baud&gt;, &lt;databits&gt;, &lt;parity&gt;, &lt;stopbits&gt;)
      
        Configures a not-yet opened port:

          &lt;baud&gt;     = baud rate; 300..3000000 bits/sec
          &lt;databits&gt; = number of data bits; 5..8
          &lt;parity&gt;   = 0=NONE, 1=ODD, 2=EVEN
          &lt;stopbits&gt; = 1=one stop bit, 2=two stop bits, 15=1.5 stop bits
        
        Example:
        
          // Configure handle 1 to 4800 bits/s, 8 databits, no parity, one stop bit:
          slConfig(1, 4800, 8, 0, 1)
          
        Supported baudrates:
          300, 600,	1200,	2400,	4800,	9600,	14400, 19200, 38400, 56000, 57600, 115200,
          128000, 256000, 921600, 1000000, 2000000, 3000000

3.4.9 slOpen
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slOpen(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;port&gt;)
      
        Opens COM port &lt;port&gt; on handle &lt;handle&gt;.
        After the call, the COM port is ready for usage.
        
        Example:
          
          // example sequence, e.g. after calling &quot;exec('slloadlib.sci')&quot;.
          // Notice: No checks done!
          // create a handle (1)
          slMount(1)
          // configure it (115k2, 7O1)
          slConfig(1, 115200, 7, 1, 1)
          // open COM4 on handle 1
          slOpen(1,4)
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR

3.4.10 slClose
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slClose(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Closes the COM port, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        Note that the handle is still valid and the library still loaded!
        You may still use the handle for everything except for sending bytes or arrays.
        A read from the buffer is still possible, but probably does not make sense ;)
        After the call, the COM port is availabe for other applications.
        
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR
          
      
3.4.11 slSendByte
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSendByte(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;byte&gt;)
      
        Sends a single byte &lt;byte&gt; 0..255, to the COM port, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        The COM port needs to be configured (&quot;slConfig()&quot;), and open (&quot;slOpen()&quot;).
        Notice that it might take &quot;some time&quot; (...) until the data is sent out. Windows ... ;-)

        Example:
        
          // send an &quot;A&quot; to the port, referenced by handle 1:
          slSendByte(1,ascii(&quot;A&quot;))
          
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR


3.4.12 slSendArray
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSendArray(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;array&gt;, &lt;size&gt;)
      
        Send an array of integers (although you may *carefully* try something else) &lt;array&gt;,
        of the size &lt;size&gt; (or lesser) to the COM port references by &lt;handle&gt;.
        If the given size argument exceeds the length of the array, a memory exception will
        occur and you have to restart Scilab.
        Notice that the complete Scilab &lt;-&gt; SiSeLi &quot;communication&quot; is pointer arithmetic.
        Unfortunately Scilab does not provide any (fast and failsafe) checks for this, so
        you really should take care of that.
        
        Scilab Tip:
          If you need to send a string (e.g.: &quot;Hello&quot;), you can easily convert it to an
          array by using:
          
            array = ascii(&quot;Hello&quot;)
            slSendArray(&lt;handle&gt;, array, length(array) )

        Example:
        
          // send &quot;BLOED&quot; to the port, referenced by handle 1:
          slSendArray(1, ascii(&quot;BLOED&quot;), 5)
          
          // send an array of integers to the port, referenced by handle 1:
          a=[68 79 79 70]
          slSendArray(1, a, length(a))
            
        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR


3.4.13 slCount
      
      &lt;count&gt;   = slCount(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Counts the number of bytes available in the receive buffer, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        
        RETURNS:
          &lt;count&gt; = number of bytes in receive buffer
          &lt;-1&gt;    = a buffer overflow occured; you have to call slFlush() to reset it
          
          
3.4.14 slReadByte
          
      &lt;byte&gt;    = slReadByte(&lt;handle&gt;,&lt;blocking&gt;)
      
        Reads (and removes) a byte from the receive buffer, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        The &lt;blocking&gt; parameter specifies its behaviour:
        
          &lt;blocking=0&gt;  -&gt; the function always returns immediately
          &lt;blocking=1&gt;  -&gt; the functions waits (blocks all) untila at least one byte is available
        
        RETURNS:
          &lt;byte&gt;  = a received byte
          &lt;-1&gt;    = ERROR: nothing in buffer, overflow or port not opened or available

          
3.4.15 slFlush          
          
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slFlush(&lt;handle&gt;)
      
        Flushes (empties) the receive buffer, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        If an overflow flag is set, it is reset.
        
        RETURNS
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR


3.4.16 slReadArray

      &lt;array&gt;   = slReadArray(&lt;handle&gt;)

        To speed up reading, more than a single byte may be read by slReadArray(), on the port
        referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        Size of &lt;array&gt; is fixed to 33 bytes. The first byte determines the number of valid bytes
        following. The rest of the array is filled up with &quot;-1&quot;
        E.g.: If the buffer contains 5 received bytes

          65, 66, 67, 68, 69
          
        &lt;array&gt; will be:

          index:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8      33
          content: 5, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, -1, -1, ... -1
        
        Example usage in Scilab:

          tmp=[]
          data=[]
          while 1 then
            tmp=slReadArray(1)
            data=[data tmp(1,2:1+tmp(1))]
            if tmp(1) &lt; 32 then
              break
            end
          end
          
        Scilab Tip:
          If &lt;array&gt; contains a string (ascii characters), it can easily be converted via:
          
            str = ascii(&lt;array&gt;)
          
        RETURNS
          &lt;array&gt; = [ &lt;N&gt; &lt;data1&gt; &lt;data2&gt; ... &lt;dataN&gt; ]


3.4.17 slReadArrayN

      &lt;array&gt;   = slReadArray(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;length&gt;)

        By popular demand:
        This function behaves exactly like &quot;slReadArray&quot; above, except it takes a second
        argument which specifies the length of data to read.
        
        &lt;length&gt; must be &gt;1 and &lt;31000.
        
        Size of &lt;array&gt; is at least &lt;length+1&gt;.
        The first byte determines the number of valid bytes following.
        The rest of the array is filled up with &quot;-1&quot;
        E.g.: If the buffer contains 5 received bytes

          65, 66, 67, 68, 69

        executing
        
          tmp = slReadArrayN(1, 1000)
          
         will return an &lt;array&gt; like this:

          index:   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8     1001
          content: 5, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, -1, -1, ... -1
          
        RETURNS
          &lt;array&gt; = [ &lt;N&gt; &lt;data1&gt; &lt;data2&gt; ... &lt;dataN&gt; ]
          

3.4.18 slSendPacket

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSendPacket(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;array&gt;, &lt;size&gt;)

        By default, slSendPacket() creates a
        
          &lt; PSTART &gt;&lt;   DATA  &gt;&lt;  PEND  &gt;

        packet. With
        
          &lt;PSTART&gt; = &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;STX&gt;
          &lt;PEND&gt;   = &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;
      
        this results in a
          
          &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;STX&gt;&lt;array+DLE&gt;&lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;

        packet, which is then sent out to the com PORT, referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        If the given &lt;size&gt; argument exceeds the length of &lt;array&gt;, a memory exception will
        occur and you have to restart Scilab.
        Packet start &lt;PSTART&gt;, packet end &lt;PEND&gt; and the special &lt;DLE&gt; character can be
        configured by:
        
          slSetPacketStart()    // allows 2 bytes for packet start; range from 1..255 (0 skips)
          slSetPacketEnd()      // allows 2 bytes for packet end;   range from 1..255 (0 skips)
          slSetPacketChar()     // allows 1 bytes for &quot;data link escape&quot; character; range 1..255
          
        Example:
        
          // our array, that needs to be sent
          a = [14 15 16 17 18]
          
          // send it to handle 1
          slSendPacket(1, a, length(a))

        Assuming that &lt;PSTART&gt; = &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x02&gt;, &lt;PEND&gt; = &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x03&gt; and &lt;DLE&gt; = &lt;0x10&gt;,
        the sent packet looks like this:
        
          &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x02&gt;&lt; 14 &gt;&lt; 15 &gt;&lt; 16 &gt;&lt; 16 &gt;&lt; 17 &gt;&lt; 18 &gt;&lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x03&gt;
          
        In hexadecimal notation (notice that 16==0x10 ;-):
        
          &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x02&gt;&lt;0x0E&gt;&lt;0x0F&gt;&lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x11&gt;&lt;0x12&gt;&lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x03&gt;
          
        In &lt;array&gt;, every character, that equals &lt;DLE&gt; (&quot;packet character&quot; or data link escape &quot;DLE&quot;),
        is doubled. It can be set via slSetPacketChar().

        RETURNS:
          1     = OK
          0     = ERROR

          
3.4.19 slSetPacketStart

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSetPacketStart(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;array&gt;)
      
        See slSendPacket() for a description of the packet sending mechanism.
        Sets the 2 byte &quot;packet start&quot; string on the COM port referenced by &lt;handle&gt;, to
        the content of &lt;array&gt;.
        If a single byte should be used for &quot;packet start&quot;, the second byte can be set
        to &quot;0&quot; (zero), e.g. [16 0].
        If &quot;packet start&quot; should not be used (e.g., you only need a packet end), call the
        function with [0 0].
        Notice: Size of &lt;array&gt; must always be at least 2!
        
        Examples:
        
          // Set packet start to &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x02&gt; (the classic &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;STX&gt;), on handle 1.
          // The raw data array [       14 15 16 17 18 19 ], 6 bytes,
          // will get sent as   [ 16 02 14 15 16 17 18 19 ], 8 bytes.
          slSetPacketStart(1,[16 2])

          // Set packet start to a single &lt;255&gt;, on handle 1.
          // The raw data array [     14 15 16 17 18 19 ], 6 bytes,
          // will get sent as   [ 255 14 15 16 17 18 19 ], 7 bytes.
          slSetPacketStart(1,[255 0])

          // Turn off packet start, on handle 1:
          slSetPacketStart(1,[0 0])
          
        RETURNS
          1     = OK
      

3.4.20 slSetPacketEnd

      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSetPacketEnd(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;array&gt;)
      
        See slSendPacket() for a description of the packet sending mechanism.
        Sets the 2 byte &quot;packet end&quot; string on the COM port referenced by &lt;handle&gt;, to
        the content of &lt;array&gt;.
        If a single byte should be used for &quot;packet end&quot;, the second byte can be set
        to &quot;0&quot; (zero), e.g. [16 0].
        If &quot;packet end&quot; should not be used (e.g., you only need a packet start), call the
        function with [0 0].
        Notice: Size of &lt;array&gt; must always be at least 2!
        
        Examples:
        
          // Set packet end to &lt;0x10&gt;&lt;0x03&gt; (the classic &lt;DLE&gt;&lt;ETX&gt;), on handle 1.
          // The raw data array [ 14 15 16 17 18 19       ], 6 bytes,
          // will get sent as   [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 16 03 ], 8 bytes.
          slSetPacketEnd(1,[16 3])

3.4.21 slSetPacketChar
      
      &lt;ret&gt;     = slSetPacketChar(&lt;handle&gt;, &lt;byte&gt;)
      
        Sets the &quot;special character&quot;, also known as the classic &lt;DLE&gt; (data link escape), for
        the communication with the COM port referenced by &lt;handle&gt;.
        If &lt;byte&gt; is in the range 1..255, any data byte of the same value is doubled.
        If &lt;byte&gt; is &quot;0&quot; (zero), the send string is sent unmodified.
        
        Examples:

          // Use classic &lt;DLE&gt; (0x10) during transmission on handle 1:
          // After the call, every data byte, with a value of &quot;16&quot; will be doubled:
